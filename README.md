## Vision ‚ú®

`Microsoft Teams` is used to help teams work together remotely. You can find chat, video calls, and other tools within this application. It allows you to work effectively online with others alongside anytime anywhere. In my clone you just need to sign up with your Google or Facebook accounts then you can use any feature.

This Project repository Contains 2 folders : 

`Frontend` In this the user authentication and group chat feature is deployed.

`Backend`  The Video call feature that is the backend of this project is built in this folder.

## Adopt Agile Methodology üíª

To make this application I use Agile Development and Work on **4 sprints** of `1 week each`.

**Phase 1 - Requirement Analysis Phase:** Where I understand the requirements to develop this project and plan accordingly. Read all the documentation of the tech stack I planned to used in my project and document them properly.

**Phase 2 - Designing Phase:** I tranform my requiremnts into a suitable structure for implementation of programming languauge. So, it becomes easy for me to code.

**Phase 3 - Building Phase:** Here I start working on the mandatory feature of the project that is to make video call with peers. For this part I used WebRTC Peer to peer library, Nodejs, Socket.io, Express. After that I work on the Group Chat Feature which I made using React, Chatengine.io.

**Phase 3** - Work on refining my codebase and UI of the project.

## Learning From the Project

It's an amazing experience to be part of this amazing Microsoft Engage Program'2021. From working on the frontend to become a person to deploy a full stack web application, I learned alot through this journey and under the guidance of my mentors Ashutosh Parija Sir and Saahiljeet Sir.

‚Ä¢ I learn backend programming which I never did before.

‚Ä¢ Get to know about Agile methodology and how it work in industries from Agile workshops.

‚Ä¢ Get knowledge about different libraries and APIs.

‚Ä¢ Learned Reactjs and Nodejs both are new to me.

‚Ä¢ Did so many errors while implementing even a mandatory feature but debugging my code is also a great way of getting knowledge. 

‚Ä¢ Happy that I prepared a whole full stack project for my own with so many features which is not possible without these deadlines.



## Challenges

‚Ä¢ Previously I don't have any knowledge about any webrtc and peerjs libraries or working with  API so its kinda tough to go through their  documentation and then learn and implementing that stuff. 

‚Ä¢ Faced difficulty in storing chat history.
