## Vision ✨

`Microsoft Teams` is used to help teams work together remotely. You can find chat, video calls, and other tools within this application. It allows you to work effectively online with others alongside anytime anywhere. In my clone you just need to sign up with your Google or Facebook accounts.



## Adopt Agile Methodology 💻

To make this application I use Agile Development and Work on 4 sprints of 1 week each.

* **Phase 1 - Requirement Analysis Phase:** Where I understand the requirements to develop this project and plan accordingly. Read all the documentation of the tech stack used in this project and document them properly.
* **Phase 2 - Designing Phase:** I tranform my requiremnts into a suitable structure for implementation of programming languauge. So, it becomes easy for me to code.
* **Phase 3 - Building Phase:** Here I start working on the mandatory feature of the project that is to make video call with peers. For this part I used Webrtc Peer to peer library, Nodejs, Socket.io, Express. After that I work on the Group Chat Feature which I made using React, Chatengine.io.
* **Phase 3** - WOrk on refine my codebase and UI of the project.
